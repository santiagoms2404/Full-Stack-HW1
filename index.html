<h2 class="leftHeader">About me...</h2>

<p class="borderStyle1">
    My name is Santiago Marin Suarez, I'm 20 years old and was born in Mexico City.
    I lived most of my childhood in Mexico city, but then I moved to Merida, Yucatan.
    I studied middle school and high school in Merida and one of the reasons why I moved there
    was that most of my family live there and for me to be able to play tennis. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Now I'm a sophomore I am an international student-athlete and my major is computer science. 
    I also form part of the tennis team here at Southwestern College, Kansas.
